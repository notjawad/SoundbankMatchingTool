# Notice

Due to how the [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) bootloader works, Windows Defender might detect the release as a virus. Read more: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/6062

Alternatively you can compile yourself

```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller -F -w -n "SoundbankMatchingTool" main.py
```
